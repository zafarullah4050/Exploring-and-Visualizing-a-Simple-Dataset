This repository contains the tasks completed during my AI and Machine Learning internship. Each task involves data loading, exploration, and visualization to better understand patterns and insights.

## 📨 Task 1: Spam Dataset Analysis

### 🎯 Objective:
To analyze a spam message dataset and understand message characteristics based on text length and label distribution.

### 📂 Dataset:
- `spam.csv` (UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset)

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### 📈 Visualizations:
- Countplot to show class distribution (Spam vs Ham)
- Histogram for message length distribution
- Boxplot to detect outliers in message lengths

### 🔍 Key Findings:
- Spam messages are generally longer than ham messages.
- The dataset is imbalanced (more ham than spam).
- Visualization helped highlight clear differences in message types.
